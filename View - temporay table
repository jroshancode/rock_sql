-- A view is a virtual table that is based on the result-set of a SELECT statement. It does not store data itself but instead acts as a stored query that, when invoked, produces a result set from one or more underlying base tables. 
-- Here are the key characteristics and benefits of MySQL views:
-- rtual Table:
-- views behave like regular tables, allowing users to query them using SELECT statements, but they do not physically store data.
Stored Query:
A view definition encapsulates a SELECT query. When you query the view, MySQL executes this underlying query to retrieve the data.


drop view if exists orders_recods ;

create or replace view orders_recods as ( 
select o.*,e.* 
from employees as e join Orders as o  
on o.customer_id = e.EmpId 
where e.salary >= 35000
) ;

select * from orders_recods;
